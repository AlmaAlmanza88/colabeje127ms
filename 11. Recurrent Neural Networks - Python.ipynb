        "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of neural network that excels when your data can be treated as a sequence - such as text, music, speech recognition, connected handwriting, or data over a time period. \n",

        "RNN's can analyse or predict a word based on the previous words in a sentence - they allow a connection between previous information and current information.\n",
